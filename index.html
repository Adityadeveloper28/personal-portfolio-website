                <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.</p>

                <p>Writing about yourself is one of the easy tasks. Everyone is different, and when you write about
                    yourself,

                    you are showing your uniqueness. It’s one of the ways you can put forth the things you know about
                    yourself.

                    Then,
                    you can continue writing about your hobbies and talents. Some people prefer to write about how they
                    acquired
                    some of the hobbies that they possess.
                    Writing the essay may help you get to know yourself. Thus, you will not lose any interest while
